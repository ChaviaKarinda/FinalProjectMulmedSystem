# FinalProjectMulmedSystem

is an arcade-style game in which the user controls the Alien, which moves persistently to the right. The player must guide Alien between pairs of stack with similarly sized gaps positioned at various heights. Alien lowers naturally and only ascends when the player presses the keyboard. Each successful pass through a pair of stack earns one point to the player. When you collide with a Monster, the game is over. During the game over screen, the player receives a bronze medal if they have 10 or more points, a silver medal if they have twenty points,and a platinum medal from ten points.
